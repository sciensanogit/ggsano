## How to create Sciensano style graphics

At the Sciensano R team, we have developed an R package and an R github page to make the process of creating publication-ready graphics in our in-house style using Râ€™s ggplot2 library a more reproducible process, as well as making it easier for people new to R to create graphics.

The github page manual below should hopefully help anyone who wants to make graphics like these:

## Load all the libraries you need

## Install the bbplot package

## Make Arial font available in R

## How does the ggsano package work?

## Save out your finished chart
